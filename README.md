# Sebastian-Sidebar
This is my basically my first ever OG website, but I tried to make it using a side navbar and SASS.

# About using SASS
On release V1, I used a VSCode extension to compile my SASS files to regular CSS. But, after watching Kevin's video on why I should not use an extension to compile, I decided to stop doing it. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4cECvhrBo8).

I have sucessfully done it the right way and have avoided VSCode extensions. I set up SASS with the help of [this video](https://youtu.be/wYWf2m_yzBQ). Thank you Mr. Powell!
