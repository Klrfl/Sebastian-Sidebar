# Sebastian-Sidebar
This is my OG website, but using a side navbar. I made this so I can practice making a whole website. I like making sidebars :)

# About using SASS
On release V1, I used a VSCode extension to compile my SASS files to regular CSS. But, after watching Kevin's video on why I should not use an extension to compile, I decided to stop doing it. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4cECvhrBo8).

I have sucessfully tried to do it the right way and have avoided VSCode extensions. I set up SASS/SCSS with the help of [this article](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/how-to-setup-sass-in-your-project-2bo1), big thanks to Chrissie!
